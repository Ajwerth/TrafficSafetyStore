# Alec Wertheimer's Coding Exercise

## User Agent Function

### Intial Thought Process
My thought process when I was writing this function was to make it as reusable and declarative as possible. By that I mean, I wanted to write it so that if the database is updated none of the code of the functuin will need to be changed.

### What I would add if I had more time
One thing I would definitely add is some form of testing just to make sure that the function is working as intended.

## About Us Page

### Thought Process
I wanted to stick to the prompt and only use bootstrap for the whole page. I tried to keep everything as organized as possible, and use the correct html elements.

### What I would change or add if I had more time
One thing I would change is how I built out the header. Like I said I tried to stick to bootstrap but if I could do it again I would use flexbox only for the header and not try to build it with bootstrap. Bootstrap is great for simpler page layout, but as you add more elements it quicly makes the markdown unorganized and hard to deal with. Flexbox would be a better option as you would need less mark up and would have mor control over positioning of certain elements. Bootstrap also adds a lot of styling that made it tricky to build such a customized header.

I also would try to build this out in React as opposed to just static HTML, that way I could build reusable components which would save a lot of time and be easier to maintain. A resuable Team Member component would be extrememly helpful for the Our Team Section.

Another thing I would do is make the page fully responsive. I initially had the plan to do this but building out the header took a lot longer than I had anticipated.

One other thing I would do is set up a compilier so we could use sass which would greatly increase the organizaiotn of the stylesheet. 

Hopefully what I've completed will give you enough insight into my thought process and how I handle certian challenges.
